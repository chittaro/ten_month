# Each line must start with the keyword "project" or "testcase" (without quotes).
# A "project" hint is based on their total project score, and must be followed by:
#   1) A string min:max representing the range of total scores [) to receive this hint (use 101 max for everyone, even scores of 100)
#   2) The hint text
# A "testcase" hint must be followed by:
#   1) A valid testcase name
#   2) A keyword about when to give that hint
#      a) "success": the hint is given if they have a correct answer, and are within both time and memory limits
#      b) "overtime": they must have a correct answer, but if they are over time (regardless of memory status) they receive the hint
#      c) "overmemory": they must have a correct answer, but if they are over memory (regardless of time) they receive the hint
#      d) "incorrect": they must have an incorrect answer, not TLE or SIG.
#   3) The hint text
#
# NOTE: Hint text should not contain double-quote marks!
testcase 1N1Limt overtime Make sure you're efficient about median mode; watch the video.
testcase F9v incorrect If you're wrong on line 3 with different trader and quantity, you're not breaking ties correctly.

testcase Pm3imt incorrect If you're wrong on line 29 with different median stock price, you're not breaking ties correctly.
testcase Pm1imt incorrect If you're wrong on line 50447 with times of 0 and 0, be careful how you 'improve' the time traveler: subtracting unsigned is dangerous.
