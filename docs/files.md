# Starter and Sample Files
{: .primer-spec-toc-ignore }

Project 2a includes one starter file P2random.h, used for PR mode.

In addition to the project specification, there are two input files that
you can use for testing: Small (100 trades) and Large (100,000 trades).
There are PR and TL mode versions of every input file; these are equivalent.

Every input file has corresponding output files named with -all (all command
line flags turned on), as well as -i (just trader info), -m (just median),
-t (just time traveler), and -v (just verbose)....

Download all files:
[p2-stocks.tgz](p2-stocks.tgz)
