Still TODO
----------

This whole project has a problem with signed vs. unsigned. We should drop any
errors related to negative numbers, and just make all values readable with
uint32_t values.

Done
----
Add to comments: copy constructor doesn't have to preserve structure.

In future semester, replace solution with newSolution, it is more
economical on both time and memory, avoids pointers, etc.
It has the same code for bugs, but should be checked that they are
still all catchable.

Make sure to test --trader_info with a non-hidden testcase.
